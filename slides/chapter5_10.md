# Model comparison via ROC Curve & AUC

name: Erin LeDell - Instructor

Notes: In the remaining exercises, we will perform a model comparison across all types of models that we've learned about so far: Decision Trees, Bagged Trees, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). 

In chapter 3, we introduced AUC as a performance metric to compare binary classification models. We will use the test set predictions from each of the models and compute test set AUC.  The model with the highest AUC is considered to be the best performing model.  

After, weâ€™ll visualize the ROC curves for each of the model and plot them all on the same graph.  

Let's jump into some R code.
